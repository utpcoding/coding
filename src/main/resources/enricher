Implement Enricher

The enrich method takes a data set(key value pairs) and calculate a target field based on the input, and return the total data set.

Here is the formula:
PV = Price / ((1 + Rate) ^ Year)

For example, the input could be:
{
    Id: "A0001",
    Rate: 0.1,
    Year: 4,
    Price: 100,
    Date: "2018-03-03"
}

The enricher should calculate PV, then return:
{
    Id: "A0001",
    Rate: 0.1,
    Year: 4,
    Price: 100,
    Date: "2018-03-03"
    PV: 62.0921323
}

Please note:
1. Decimal precision is 7, rounding rule is round-up.
   For example, if result is 62.092132311, then it should be saved as 62.0921323.
2. Ending zeros are not needed. For example, if result is 32.0000, then it should be saved as 32.
3. If PV cannot be calculated, just return the input.
4. All numbers in the input data set are BigDecimal. If a number is not BigDecimal, then it's not a valid input.
